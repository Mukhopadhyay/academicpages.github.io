Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">, Welcome to my portfolio.

I am a data scienctist from Kolkata, working in Mumbai. I am guided by the principals of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data' target='_blank'><b>Open Data</b></a> and try to work hard and contribute to the Open source community to bridge the gap that currently exists. Most of my work you'll see will be basd on data wrangling, collecting & overall easier representation of data. (For example, <a href='https://github.com/Mukhopadhyay/restdf' target='_blank'><code>restdf</code></a>)

I love creating & finding interesting datasets and seeing what can be done with them. Stay tuned on my Kaggle & Github for more of my datasets.
