Hi there, Welcome to portfolio.

Well, a bit about me I am guided by the principals of Open Data and try to work hard and contribute to the Open source community to bridge the gap that currently exists. Most of my work you'll see will be based on data wrangling, collecting & overall easier representation of data.

I love creating & finding interesting datasets and seeing what can be done with them. Stay tuned on my Kaggle for more of my datasets.
