Founded and maintained since 2005, YouTube is one of the internet's biggest platforms. With their number of videos watched per day exceeding **1 Billion**, it's easy for any user to differentiate genres just by glancing at the thumbnail and the Title. My inspiration to make this dataset was to try and answer the question of _whether it is equally easy for a computer to do_.

This dataset contains subtitles from over `91` different YouTubers, ranging from all different kinds of categories. The data were collected and cleaned (as much as necessary) by me. Currently, the dataset contains `2515` unique videos and their subtitles. There are `11` columns in the dataset.

This dataset contains Question and Answer data from Amazon, totaling around 1.4 million answered questions. The data were collected and made available by [Prof. Julian McAuley](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/) of [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) (University of San Diego). 

**Acknowledgements**

This data was acquired from Prof. Julian's website. Different categories of data were present in independent archive files (each question being a separate `JSON` file in the archive). I joined them and added the attribute `Category` for ease of use. Please go through the ICDM paper, in particular, it goes into great detail on the potential of this dataset. That was one of my major inspirations for creating this dataset.
